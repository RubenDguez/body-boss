# Body Boss

A comprehensive fitness tracking web application designed to help users manage their workouts, track progress, and stay motivated. 

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to create an accessible and user-friendly platform for fitness enthusiasts to track their exercise routines and monitor progress over time.

### Why Build This Project?
We built Body Boss to address the lack of a cohesive, easy-to-use fitness tracking tool that integrates various features such as progress tracking, workout planning, and motivational resources in one place.

### Problem It Solves
Body Boss solves the problem of scattered and inconsistent fitness tracking by providing a centralized hub for all fitness-related activities. It ensures users can track their progress, set goals, and stay motivated.

### What Did We Learn?
During the development of Body Boss, we learned about the intricacies of client-side storage, the importance of responsive design, and the effectiveness of using CSS frameworks for rapid development. We also gained insights into user experience design and the importance of intuitive interfaces.
